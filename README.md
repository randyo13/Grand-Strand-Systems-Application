# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  To ensure my code is functional and secure, I focused on thorough testing and adhering to security best practices. I used JUnit tests to cover various scenarios in the Contact Service, Task Services, and Appointment Service classes ensuring that all functionalities behaved correctly. I also incorporated secure coding practices such as validating inputs, and handling sensitive data carefully to protect against common vulnerabilities. 
  
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

 When interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program involves understanding the requirements and translating them into effective technical solutions. For the Grand Strand project, this meant ensuring the Contact Service, Task Service, and Appointment Service provided seamless management of contacts, tasks, and appointments. 
 
# How do I approach designing software?

  When approaching software design, I start by understanding the requirements. This involves gathering detailed specifications and identifying key functionalities. In the Grand Strand project, the design was broken down into manageable components, focusing on services like Contact Service, Task Service, and Appointment Service. I designed each component to address specific user needs while ensuring scalability and maintainability.
